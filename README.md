## Lipid Membrane Simulation Visualization

Examplpe of visualizing all-atom MD simulations of a complex lipid bilayer containing sterol modified lipids using `Luxor.jl` package.
The instantateous local thickness is shown for both leaflets in addition to the position and instantaneous order of the acyl chains of the lipids.
As expected, local order correlates with local thickness of the bilayer.
